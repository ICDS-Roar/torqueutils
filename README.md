# Overview
Welcome to my repository torqueutils! This repository just contains a collection of code that is used by the [ICDS](https://www.icds.psu.edu/) i-ASK center on torque to retrieve information about users jobs on the Roar supercomputer. The tools have various usages, so I will describe them below:

* **getusersjobids:** Retrieve users job ids for processing and analyzation.
* **getjobinfo:** Query information about a job or multiple jobs.

# Installation
In order to install the torqueutils collect, simply use the following commands below:

```bash
